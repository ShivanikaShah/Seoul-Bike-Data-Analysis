# Seoul-Bike-Data-Analysis
Regression Analysis of Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset

Currently, Rental Bikes are introduced in many major cities for the enhancement of mobility, 
comfort, and eco-friendly transportation. It is important to make the rental bike available and 
accessible to the public at the right time as it reduces the waiting time. Eventually, providing the 
city with a stable supply of rental bikes is a major concern. There are many factors like 
temperature, time of day, holidays, seasons, etc that might affect the availability of bikes. The 
crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental 
bikes. 

In this project, we aim to use statistics to determine which factors lead to optimal supply of bikes 
rented at each hour. For example, if the temperature is too high and visibility is poor, we will 
supply a smaller number of bikes as the demand will be less. If our model is successful, it will 
allow bike owners and managers to decide the count of bikes to be rented at any given time. Bike 
users will also experience a friendly and comfortable service.
